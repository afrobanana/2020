              and Sousami, two of the most iconic bars on the island; as well as
              the Brandy Sour collective, Animafest animation festival,
              Antiskino Theatre Festival and custom build Reggae sound system
              Roots Crew, as the daily custodians of festival fun.

            <h3>Camping</h3>
            <p>
              Our festival campsite this year is at the most magical location on
              the island. Really make the most of the five-day event by pitching
              your tent in the shady oasis of Val’s sweeping gardens and sleep
              under the stars. Our shade-providing structures and dense orange
              tree fields provide for a relaxing and cool outdoor space for your
              comfort. As the festival grounds are smaller and cosier this year,
              the AfroBanana family and friends are advised to get tickets in
              good time and arrive early to guarantee their spot at this annual
              gathering of like-minded individuals.{' '}
