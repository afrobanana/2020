      <dt>MEDICAL HELP & EMERGENCIES</dt>
      <dd>
        A team of professional medics will be on-site 24/7 throughout the event,
        always on hand to provide first aid and medical assistance in case of
        emergencies. If help is needed, please contact your nearest security
        guard or member of the AfroBanana team.

      <dt>FIRE SAFETY</dt>
      <dd>
        Cyprus gets very hot and very dry in the summer month, so we take fire
        safety at AfroBanana Festival very seriously. Fires spread quickly, and
        easily so lighting them is strictly forbidden anywhere on site. You’re
        here to party, not burn the whole place to the ground! Stay aware and if
        there’s one rule you stick to, make it this one!
      </dd>

      <dt>CLEANLINESS & RECYCLING</dt>
      <dd>
        Thanks to your support, we have managed to reduce overall waste by a
        third per person over the past few years. But we want to continue
        improving and we need your help. We’ve arranged for a spot of
        post-festival recycling, so please respect your beautiful surroundings
        rather than leaving your mark, and separate your rubbish, taking any
        non-recyclables away when you leave. .{' '}
      </dd>

      <dt>LITTER & DESIGNATED BINS</dt>
      <dd>
        When the madness is over, we want to leave the site as beautiful as it
        was when we got there, so designated on-site bins will be located across
        the festival grounds, with clear labels for rubbish separation. Please
        be mindful and use them! And smokers, please do not chuck your butts on
        the floor and more importantly the beach. The sea is home to many
        creatures who don’t want your butts (or any other rubbish the waves
        carried out) for dinner. Karma will be watching you!

      <dt>DRINKING WITHOUT WASTE</dt>
      <dd>
        In an effort to minimize waste, our amazing eco cups made of recyclable
        plastic are back for 2019. Since we successfully launched the re-usable
        cup system three years ago, we’ve saved over 35,000 plastic cups that
        would have otherwise ended up in a landfill. Cool right! So, keep
        supporting the cause and pick up your collectable 2019 cup at the
        festival this year for just 1 euro. You are also welcome to bring your
        own AfroBanana cup that you collected through the years!

      <dt>RENEWABLE ENERGY</dt>
      <dd>
        Our dedicated renewable energy team will be rebuilding our recharging
        dome and bicycle generator again this year, so that you can keep your
        phone juiced all festival long. You know the drill by now… Step 1: Get
        on the bicycle; Step 2: Start giving it some of your very best pedal
        power; Step 3: Plug your phone into the charging cable, and Step 4: Call
        your friends to come chill out inside the Dome, while you work!
