Berlin based DJ Plattenali is an unsung underground hero who has celebrated residencies in world famous clubs for over 10 years. He is a true old school DJ who started playing vinyl in 1999 and still takes crowds on extremely energetic sets, in his ever-evolving house, deep house, acid house, minimal and tech house style. Little wonder that his motto is ‘Let’s Dance’!
