Originally from Tokyo, and now based in London, solo-act Anchorsong has become globally recognised for his unique live shows where he creates electronic music completely live using only a sampler and a keyboard. Psychedelic, danceable and free-spirited, his music blurs the boundary between rhythm and melody, in what has been described as a truly spellbinding show.
