Get ready to move your feet to the eclectic sounds of Trio Tekke, taking listeners on a musical exploration, where traditional urban rebetiko, merges with jazz, Latin funk, reggae and psychedelia. Raising the roof with louder and punchier sounds, the original trio will perform as a quartet, with Antonis Antoniou, Lefteris Moumtzis and Colin Somervell, joined by drummer Dave De Rose.
